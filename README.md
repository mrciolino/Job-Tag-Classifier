# Cutback
Code for cutback's tag prediction model. We take a job title and description and predict the tags associate with that job. We do this through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This model will train itself to become more accurate as more jobs are added. The model will also associate new industry words with the correct job tag as they come out.
